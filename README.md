# Convolutional Neural Networks

## Hey There!

This repo consists of some of the code I've written for studying and implementing Convolutional Neural Networks in Python. In Deep Learning, CNNs are a class of networks that are commonly used for analyzing visual imagery. In CNNs the weights, in the form of filters or kernels are shared along the inputs to learn feature represenations and produce feature maps. Sparse connectivity is another important attribute of such networks, i.e. the kernels used are smaller than the image being processed and therefore the connections between the input and output layers are reduced. In the notebook attached, we will work with some convolution operations, build our network with PyTorch and also import and train some popular CNNs available in published research.


Notebook Outline:
- Importing and visualizing data from the CIFAR-10 datset.
